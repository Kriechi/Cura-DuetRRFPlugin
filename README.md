# Cura-DuetRRFPlugin
Plugin for Cura 3 that adds output devices for a Duet RepRapFirmware printer: "Print", "Simulate", and "Upload".

## Installation

With Cura not running, unpack the zip file from the [release](https://github.com/Kriechi/Cura-DuetRRFPlugin/releases/latest) to this specific folder:

### Windows
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\cura\3.2\plugins\Cura-DuetRRFPlugin`

### Mac
`~/Library/Application Support/Cura/3.2/plugins/Cura-DuetRRFPlugin`

### Linux
`/home/<username>/.local/share/cura/3.2/plugins/Cura-DuetRRFPlugin`

Be careful, the unzipper often tacks on the name of the zip as a folder at the
bottom and you don't want it nested.  You want the files to show up in that
folder.

## Running from source
Alternatively you can run from the source directly. It'll make it easy to
update in the future. Use git to clone this repository into the folders given
above.

## Configuration

* Start Cura
* From the menu bar choose: Extensions -> DuetRRF -> DuetRRF Connections
* Click "Add"
* Enter the name of your printer
* Enter the URL to your DuetRRF instance, e.g., http://printer.local or http://192.168.1.42
* Leave "HTTP Basic Auth" empty if you don't run a reverse-proxy
* Click "Ok"
* Done! Look at the bottom right - there should be the big blue button with you printer name on it!

## Features

* Upload / Simulate / Print
* Works with HTTP and HTTPS connections and URLS
* Works with HTTP Basic Auth (optional)
* Works with RRF passwords (if you used `M551`, default is `reprap`)
* No support for UNC paths as URL


## Use
After you load up a model and it has sliced, click the down arrow button on the
"Print to (PrinterName)" button on the lower right hand corner. It will upload
the gcode file to the SD card and start printing it. You can select "Simulate
on (PrinterName)" to upload and simulate the print, which returns the simulated
print time an the actual printer. Or you can just "Upload to (PrinterName)" to
copy the gcode to the SD card.
